A research project undertaken over the course of six weeks at PROMYS Europe 2024. The project concerns the problem of finding explicit bijections between certain families of finite sets that appear in various combinatorial and algebraic contexts.
The file PhiTilde.cpp contains a program that maps primitive binary necklaces to permutations via the map \widetilde{\Phi}^+ as defined in the project.
